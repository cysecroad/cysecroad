# Whoami and Why I Write

Â¡Saludos my tech amigos! *Y todos los demas(everyone else as well)*\
I'm a computer science graduate currently working as digital design verification engineer.\
In this role, I ensure the reliability and functionality of complex digital systems, create verification IPs that are designed for further use, or participate in creating plans and documentation for specific designs.\
Alongside my profesional pursuits, I'm also learning Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ after i visited Madrid once(then came back a month later :smiley: ) so i can be prepared for future visits.
