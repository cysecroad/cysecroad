# The Actually Useful Linux Config Files

¡Hola tech amigos! Remember that feeling when you first moved into a new place? Everything feels... off. The light switches are in weird places, you keep opening the wrong drawer for cutlery, and don't even get me started on finding the bathroom at night. Well, a fresh Linux install feels the same - *¡pero no te preocupes!* (don't worry!), we're about to fix that.\
After years of SSH-ing into different machines and feeling like a stranger in my own terminal, I've decided to put all my configurations in one place. And no, this isn't another "look at my fancy terminal with rainbow prompts and ASCII art" guide. This is about configurations that actually make you more productive.


## Why another Linux Config guide?

Look, I get it. There are probably thousands of dotfiles repositories on GitHub. But after years of working with Linux systems - from local development machines to remote servers where you can't afford to make mistakes - I've learned that the best configurations aren't the most complex ones. They're the ones that:
- Work consistently across different environments
- Don't break when you copy them to a new machine
- Actually help you work faster instead of looking cool
- Prevent common mistakes that waste your time

To keep this short, you can check them now at: [My GitHub](https://github.com/cysecroad/my_configs)

### What's Inside

This guide covers four essential configuration files that are in use daily:
- .bashrc - Making your shell work for you, not against you
- tmux.conf - Because terminal multiplexing shouldn't require three hands
- vimrc - Vim configurations that don't require a PhD to understand
- inputrc - Those small readline tweaks that make a big difference

## Bash Configuration: Making Your Shell Work Smarter

*¿Sabes qué?* (You know what?) Your shell is like your workspace. If you're constantly searching for things or repeating the same actions, something's wrong. Let's fix that.

### TL;DR

- What: Your shell's brain – how it remembers, behaves, and helps you
- Why: Because typing the same commands 100 times isn't muy inteligente
- Key Features: Smart history, safety nets, Git integration
- Recovery: `mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.broken && cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/` to reset to defaults

### The Basics: What Goes Where

~/.bashrc: Your personal shell settings
/etc/bash.bashrc: System-wide settings
Remember: Personal settings (~/.bashrc) override system settings

### History Management: Never Lose That Important Command Again

```bash
shopt -s histappend
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups
export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -n; history -w; history -c; history -r"
# Remove duplicates from history while preserving order
tac "$HISTFILE" | awk '!x[$0]++' >| /tmp/tmpfile  && 
    tac /tmp/tmpfile >| "$HISTFILE"
rm /tmp/tmpfile

# Increase history size for better command recall
export HISTSIZE=10000
export HISTFILESIZE=10000

export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "  # Add timestamps to history
export HISTIGNORE="ls:ll:cd:pwd:bg:fg:history"  # Don't record common commands

# Enable partial history search with Up/Down arrows
bind '"\e[A": history-search-backward'
bind '"\e[B": history-search-forward'
```

**Why this matters**: You ran that complex command last week to start a simulation with compilation guards, and now you need it again. Instead of googling or digging through your notes, just type the first couple of characters and press Up. Your shell will find it for you.
**Troubleshooting Tip**: If your history settings aren't working, make sure you don't have HISTSIZE=0 anywhere in your configs. Also, check if you have multiple terminal sessions wrongly overwriting each other's history.

### Safety Nets: Because Mistakes Happen

*¡La seguridad es como la salsa picante - mejor tener demasiada que muy poca!* (Safety is like hot sauce - better to have too much than too little!)

```bash
# The "prevent disasters" section
set -o noclobber                        # No accidental file overwrites
alias cp='cp -i'                        # Confirm before overwriting
alias mv='mv -i'                        # Confirm before moving
alias rm='rm -i'                        # Think twice before deleting
alias chmod='chmod --preserve-root'     # Protect root directory
alias chown='chown --preserve-root'     # Protect root ownership
```

**Why this matters**: It's 3 AM, you're tired, and you're about to run `rm -rf *` in what you think is your test directory. These aliases will save you from yourself.
**Troubleshooting Tip**: If you really need to overwrite a file with noclobber set, use `>|` instead of `>`. For example: `echo "test" >| file.txt`

### Navigation Shortcuts: Because Life's Too Short

```bash
# List directories in human-readable formats
alias ll='ls -alF'     # Detailed list
alias la='ls -A'       # Show hidden files
alias lh='ls -lh'      # Human-readable sizes
alias lsd='ls -d */'   # List only directories
alias l='ls -CF'

# I think we all know what these do
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias cdh='cd ~'
alias back='cd -'
alias ..2='cd ../..'
alias ..3='cd ../../..'
alias ..4='cd ../../../..'
```

**Why this matters**: You're navigating through a deep project structure, jumping between different components. Instead of typing cd ../../../ or the full path, these shortcuts make it natural.

### System Monitoring: Know What's Happening

```bash
# Network utilities
alias ports='netstat -tulanp'
alias localip='hostname -I'    # Show all local IP addresses
alias publicip='curl -s ifconfig.me'  # Show public IP - useful for remote access setup
alias ports='netstat -tulanp'  # Show all active ports and their processes
alias listening='netstat -tunlp'  # Show only listening ports - good for security audits

# Memory and CPU monitoring shortcuts
alias df='df -h'
alias du='du -h'
alias meminfo='free -m -l -h'  # Detailed memory usage in human readable format
alias cpuinfo='lscpu'          # CPU architecture information
alias disk='df -h | grep -v tmpfs'  # Disk usage excluding temporary filesystems

# Process monitoring - helps identify resource hogs
alias psmem='ps auxf | sort -nr -k 4 | head -10'  # Shows top 10 memory-consuming processes
alias pscpu='ps auxf | sort -nr -k 3 | head -10'  # Shows top 10 CPU-consuming processes
```
**Why this matters**: Your application is running slow, and you need to quickly check if it's a memory, CPU, or disk issue. These aliases give you that information instantly.

### Git Integration: Because We All Use Git

```bash
# Git branch in prompt (never commit to the wrong branch again)
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
# Customized prompt with git branch information
export PS1="\u@\h \[\e[32m\]\w \[\e[91m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[00m\]$ "

# Git shortcuts
alias ga='git add'
alias gaa='git add .'
alias gc='git commit -m'
alias gst='git status'
alias pull='git pull'
alias push='git push'
```
**Why this matters**: You're switching between multiple feature branches and need to know exactly where you are before making changes. The colored branch name in your prompt makes this obvious.

### The "Human" Section: Because Nobody's Perfect

```bash
# Common typos
alias sl='ls'
alias cd..='cd ..'
alias grpe='grep'
alias gti='git'

# Quality of life improvements
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3
alias grep='grep --color=auto'     # Highlight matches in grep output
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'   # Same for extended grep
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'   # Same for fixed string grep


# Tmux management made easy

# Autostart tmux with intelligent checks
if command -v tmux &> /dev/null && # verify tmux installation
   [ -n "$PS1" ] &&                # ensure interactive shell
   [[ ! "$LAUNCHED" == "vscode" ]] && # skip in VSCode
   [[ ! "$TERM" =~ screen ]] &&    # skip in screen
   [[ ! "$TERM" =~ tmux ]] &&      # skip in tmux terminal
   [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then            # skip if already in tmux
  tmux new-session -A -s main
fi
alias tmux_rel='tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf'
alias trel='tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf'
alias tmuxes='tmux ls'
alias ta='tmux attach -t'
alias tnew='tmux new -s'

# We always mean this
alias mkdir='mkdir -pv'

# This is just shorter
alias h='history'

# Command line productivity
export EDITOR=vim      # Use vim as default editor
export VISUAL=vim      # Use vim for visual editing
set -o vi             # Enable vi-style command line editing
```

**Why this matters**: It's late, your fingers are tired, and you keep typing gti status. Instead of seeing "command not found", your shell knows what you meant.

### System-wide Configurations

In /etc/bash.bashrc, keep it minimal but essential:
```bash
# Force cd to resolve physical paths (important for symlinks)
set -P

# Set default editors
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
export VISUAL=/usr/bin/vim
set -o vi             # Enable vi-style command line editing
```
**Why this matters**: When you're dealing with symlinks in production, you want to know exactly where you are. set -P ensures cd and pwd show you the real path, not the symlink path.

## Readline Configuration: The Hidden Gem of Command Line

¡Ahora viene lo bueno! (Now comes the good stuff!) While everyone's talking about their shell configs, the real MVP of command-line usability is .inputrc. It's like having autocorrect for your terminal.

### TL;DR

- What: Teaching your terminal to understand human typing
- Why: Because CAPS LOCK happens to the best of us
- Key Features: Case-insensitive completion, smart history search
- Recovery: `mv ~/.inputrc ~/.inputrc.backup` to reset

### Making Your Terminal More Intelligent

```bash
# Case-insensitive completion - because TYPING IN CAPS is hard
set completion-ignore-case on
set completion-prefix-display-length 3  # Show common prefix length

# Show all completions immediately
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# Color the common prefix in completions
set colored-completion-prefix on
set colored-stats on

# Better word movement
"\e[1;5C": forward-word    # Ctrl+Right
"\e[1;5D": backward-word   # Ctrl+Left
```

**Why this matters**: Ever tried to cd into a directory but got the capitalization wrong? Or wanted to move through your command word by word instead of character by character? These settings fix that.

### The "Oops" Prevention Settings

```bash
# Show extra file information in completion
set visible-stats on
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# More intuitive history search
"\ep": history-search-backward
"\en": history-search-forward
```

**Real-world scenario**: You're looking for that docker run command from yesterday, but all you remember is it started with "docker". Just type "docker" and press Alt+P to search through commands that start with that.

### My personal configurations

```bash
# Better word handling
set bind-tty-special-chars off    # Allow symbols in words
set skip-completed-text on        # Skip completed text in word completion

# Misc Settings
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off
set enable-keypad on

# Show mode in prompt (for vi mode)
set show-mode-in-prompt on
set vi-cmd-mode-string "\1\e[2 q\2"
set vi-ins-mode-string "\1\e[6 q\2"

# Python specific
$if Python
    set editing-mode vi
$endif
```

## Terminal Multiplexing with tmux: Your Window Manager on Steroids

¡Vamos a multiplicar! If you're tired of juggling terminal windows like a circus performer, tmux is about to become your new best friend. But let's be honest - default tmux feels about as intuitive as typing with oven mitts on. Let's fix that.

### TL;DR

- What: Your terminal's window manager on steroids
- Why: Because losing your SSH session during a critical update is no bueno
- Key Features: Intuitive splits, smart navigation, session persistence
- Recovery: `mv ~/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf.backup && tmux kill-server` to start fresh

### Why Configure tmux?

Picture this: You're SSH'd into a production server, running a critical update script that takes hours. Then your Wi-Fi hiccups or your laptop dies. *¡Ay, caramba!* Without tmux, you're in trouble. With it? Your session keeps running like nothing happened.


### The Essential tmux configuration

```bash
# First, let's make tmux more finger-friendly
# Remap prefix from 'C-b' to backtick
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix `
bind ` send-prefix

# Splitting windows with keys that make sense
bind \\ split-window -h  # Split horizontally with \
bind - split-window -v  # Split vertically with -
unbind '"'
unbind %

# Navigation without the gymnastics
bind -n M-Left select-pane -L
bind -n M-Right select-pane -R
bind -n M-Up select-pane -U
bind -n M-Down select-pane -D

# Switch windows using Shift + Arrow
bind -n S-Left previous-window
bind -n S-Right next-window

bind -n M-c new-window         # Create new window with Alt-c
bind -n M-p previous-window    # Navigate to previous window with Alt-p
bind -n M-n next-window        # Navigate to next window with Alt-n
```

**Why this matters**: Ever tried to explain to someone how to press Ctrl+B, release, then press % to split a window? Yeah, good luck with that. These bindings make sense: `\` splits horizontally (like it looks), `-` splits vertically (like it looks).
**Troubleshooting Tip**: If your Alt+Arrow keys aren't working, check if your terminal emulator is capturing them first. In many terminal applications, you might need to disable "Use Alt as Meta key" in preferences.

### Session Management like a pro

```bash
# Better session handling
setw -g monitor-activity on
set -g visual-activity on

# Quick reload of tmux config
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display-message "tmux config reloaded!"

# Prevent automatic window renaming
set-option -g allow-rename off

# Increase scrollback buffer - because sometimes you need to look way back
set-option -g history-limit 50000
```

**Why this matters**: You're monitoring multiple services across different windows. With activity monitoring enabled, you'll see when there's output in background windows - perfect for catching that deployment completion you've been waiting for.

### Making it pretty (but practical)

```bash
set -g status-bg colour234     # Dark background for better contrast
set -g status-fg colour137     # Warm foreground color
# Status bar content configuration
set -g status-left ''          # Clean left side
# Right side shows date and time - useful for screenshots and logs
set -g status-right '#[fg=colour233,bg=colour241,bold] %d/%m #[fg=colour233,bg=colour245,bold] %H:%M:%S '
set -g status-right-length 50  # Ensure enough space for status info
set -g status-left-length 20   # Balance left side spacing
```

**Why this matters**: Your status bar should tell you what you need to know at a glance. Date, time, and session name - no fancy weather reports or Bitcoin prices needed.

### The "Oops" Recovery Features

```bash
# Synchronize panes - great for running the same command on multiple servers
bind y set-window-option synchronize-panes\; \
    display-message "synchronize-panes is now #{?pane_synchronized,on,off}"

# Respawn a pane when things go wrong
bind k respawn-pane -k
```

**Why this matters**: Need to update configs across multiple servers? Enable sync-panes, type once, command runs everywhere. Just don't forget to turn it off afterwards (we've all been there 😅).

### Some additional tips

#### Terminal Types: If your colors look weird, add this to your config:
```bash
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
```

#### Copy mode: Make it work like Vim:
```bash
setw -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send -X begin-selection    # Start selection like vim
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-selection-and-cancel  # Yank like vim
```

### Mouse support: sometimes, clicking is just easier
```bash
set -g mouse on
```

### Common tmux pitfalls and how to avoid them

#### Nested tmux Sessions:

**Problem**: You SSH into a remote machine that auto-starts tmux, creating a tmux-in-tmux nightmare
**Solution**: Add these checks to your .bashrc:
```bash
if command -v tmux &> /dev/null && [ -n "$PS1" ] && [[ ! "$TERM" =~ screen ]] && [[ ! "$TERM" =~ tmux ]] && [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
  tmux new-session -A -s main
fi
```

#### Copy-paste issues
**Problem**: Copy-paste doesn't work with system clipboard
**Solution**: Install xclip or xsel and add:
```bash
bind -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel 'xclip -in -selection clipboard'
```
Or, use **SHIFT** while selecting

#### Session management
**Problem**: Lost track of what's running where
**Solution**: Use meaningful session names and this alias:
```bash
alias tmuxes='tmux ls'
```

**Troubleshooting Tip**: If your tmux configuration isn't loading, make sure your `.tmux.conf` is in your home directory (`~/.tmux.conf`). You can verify tmux is reading it by running `tmux show-options -g`.

## Vim Configuration: Making the Powerful Text Editor Actually Usable

*¡Amigos!* Let's talk about Vim. Yes, that editor everyone jokes about not being able to exit (it's :q, by the way). While Vim is powerful, its default configuration feels like trying to write with your non-dominant hand while riding a unicycle. Let's make it feel more like, you know, a normal text editor.

### TL;DR

- What: Making Vim behave like a modern text editor (but better)
- Why: Because sometimes nano just won't cut it, ¿verdad?
- Key Features: Sane defaults, human-friendly shortcuts, auto-save
- Recovery: `mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.backup && vim -u NONE` for vanilla Vim

### Why Configure Vim?

Sure, you could use nano. Or that fancy GUI editor. But sometimes you're SSH'd into a remote server, need to edit a config file, and Vim is all you've got. Plus, once configured properly, Vim becomes that "I can't believe I ever worked without this" kind of tool.

### The Essential Vim Setup

```vim
" Basic Setup - Because We're Not in 1991 Anymore
set nocompatible        " Stop pretending to be Vi
filetype on             " Detect file types
filetype plugin on      " Enable loading plugins for specific file types
filetype indent on      " Enable loading indentation rules for specific file types
syntax on               " Pretty colors!

" Interface Improvements - Make It Look Less Scary
set number                 " Line numbers are helpful
set cursorline             " Highlight current line
set wildmenu               " Enhanced command-line completion
set wildmode=list:longest  " Complete longest common string, then list alternatives
set wildignore=*.docx,*/jpg,*.png,*.gif,*.pdf,*.pyc,*.exe,*.flv,*.img,*.xlsx  " Ignore binary files in completion
```

**Why this matters**: Ever tried to copy line 476 of a log file without line numbers? Or wondered which of the 5 nested loops you're currently in? These settings make Vim visually informative.
**Troubleshooting Tip**: If your syntax highlighting looks weird, add set background=dark or set background=light based on your terminal theme.

### The "Don't Shoot Yourself in the Foot" Settings

```vim
" Safety First - Because We All Make Mistakes
set nobackup           " Don't create backup files
set autowrite          " Auto-save before running commands
set confirm            " Ask to save changes instead of failing

" Search That Actually Makes Sense
set incsearch          " Search as you type
set ignorecase         " Case-insensitive by default
set smartcase          " Unless you type capitals
nnoremap <CR> :noh<CR><CR>    " Clear search highlighting with Enter
```

**Why this matters**: You're editing a critical config file, your SSH connection drops, and... your changes are safe because Vim auto-saved them. ¡Qué alivio! (What a relief!)

### Making Vim more human

``` vim
" Keyboard Shortcuts That Don't Require Finger Gymnastics
inoremap jj <esc>      " Exit insert mode with 'jj'
nnoremap <space> :     " Space for commands

" Split navigation that makes sense
nnoremap <C-J> <C-W><C-J>    " Move down
nnoremap <C-K> <C-W><C-K>    " Move up
nnoremap <C-L> <C-W><C-L>    " Move right
nnoremap <C-H> <C-W><C-H>    " Move left
```

**Why this matters**: Ever noticed how your pinky hurts from hitting Escape? Or how Ctrl+W followed by a direction feels like playing Twister with your fingers? These mappings fix that.

## The "Where was I?" Feature

```vim
" Never Lose Your Place
set ruler              " Show cursor position
set showmatch          " Highlight matching brackets
set showcmd             " Show partial commands in status line
set showmode            " Show current mode (insert/normal/visual)

" Persistent undo - because mistakes happen
if has('persistent_undo')
    set undofile
    set undodir=~/.vim/undo
endif
```

Real-world tip: Create the undo directory first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vim/undo
```

### Making the indentation be easier on the eyes

```vim
set shiftwidth=2       " Number of spaces for auto-indent
set tabstop=2          " Number of spaces that <Tab> counts for
set expandtab          " Convert tabs to spaces
set autoindent         " Copy indent from current line when starting a new line
```

**Why this matters**: Usually, you want to have indentation set at 2 (*Trust me, I'm and engineer*)

### Some of my personal configurations

```vim
nnoremap o o<esc>      " Add new line below without entering insert mode
nnoremap O O<esc>      " Add new line above without entering insert mode
nnoremap Y y$          " Make Y behave like D and C (to end of line)

" Mouse Support
set mouse=a            " Enable mouse in all modes

" External Configuration
if filereadable("/etc/vim/vimrc.local")
  source /etc/vim/vimrc.local
endif


" Natural split opening - matches western reading direction
set splitbelow      " New horizontal splits appear below
set splitright      " New vertical splits appear right

" Use system clipboard for all operations
set clipboard=unnamed,unnamedplus   " Seamless copy/paste with system

" Enhanced status line with useful information
set laststatus=2    " Always show status line
" Detailed status line format
set statusline=%F%m%r%h%w%=(%{&ff}/%Y)\ (line\ %l\/%L,\ col\ %c)

" Code folding configuration
set foldmethod=indent    " Fold based on indentation
set foldnestmax=10      " Prevent too many folds
set nofoldenable        " Start with folds open
set foldlevel=2         " Set initial fold level

" Whitespace visualization - spot problematic spaces and tabs
set listchars=tab:>·,trail:~,extends:>,precedes:<,space:·
set list                " Show whitespace characters

" Auto-reload files changed outside vim
set autoread
au FocusGained,BufEnter * :checktime   " Check for file changes when vim regains focus

" Auto-complete brackets and indent
inoremap {<CR> {<CR>}<ESC>O   " Auto-complete curly braces
inoremap [<CR> [<CR>]<ESC>O   " Auto-complete square brackets
inoremap (<CR> (<CR>)<ESC>O   " Auto-complete parentheses

" Easier buffer management
nnoremap <silent> <Leader>b :buffers<CR>    " List all buffers
nnoremap gb :bnext<CR>                      " Go to next buffer
nnoremap gB :bprevious<CR>                  " Go to previous buffer
```

## Pro Tips From Someone Who Learned the Hard Way

1. **Start Simple**: Don't copy-paste a 500-line config file just because it looks cool. Start with basics and add what you actually use
2. **Test Before Production**: Always test new configurations in a safe environment first. *¡La precaución es la madre de la seguridad!*
3. **Document Your Changes**: Future you will thank present you for explaining why you added that weird alias
4. **Keep Backups**: Store your configs in a Git repository. Trust me, you'll need them when setting up a new machine

Remember, the best configuration is the one that helps you work more efficiently without getting in your way. These settings have survived countless late-night debugging sessions, production emergencies, and "why isn't this working?" moments.
¡Y recuerda! (And remember!) The best configuration is the one you understand and actually use daily. Don't just copy-paste - take what works for you and build upon it.\
Start with these basics, understand what each part does, and then customize based on your needs.

*¡Buena suerte en tu viaje de configuración!* (Good luck on your configuration journey!)
